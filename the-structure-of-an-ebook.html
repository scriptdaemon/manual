		<h1>The structure of an ebook</h1>
		<section id="major-partitions">
			<h2>Major partitions</h2>
			<p>We can consider that all books, including ebooks, consist of these major partitions, in this order:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Front Matter</strong>: material which appears prior to the main content of the work, which might include such items as a dedication, an epigraph, an introduction and so on.</li>
					<li><strong>Body Matter</strong>: the main content of the book. This is typically divided into chapters or in the case of a collection, individual stories or articles. It may be structured at the highest level by the author into larger divisions such as volumes or parts. It may include a prologue and/or an epilogue.</li>
					<li><strong>Back Matter</strong>: material which follows the main content, which might include an appendix, an afterword, and so on.</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>These terms become important when building the Table of Contents (ToC). The 'Landmarks' section of the ToC requires items to be labelled with the appropriate partition identifier. See <a href="toc-patterns.html">ToC Patterns</a> for more information about the ToC.</p>

		<section id="sections-of-a-book">
			<h2>Sections of a Book</h2>
			<p>A book may include any of the following sections, which are presented here in the order they are likely to occur in a a typical book.</p>
			<section id="cover">
				<h3>Cover</h3>
				<p>The cover presents the outer appearance of the book, usually consisting of an image, the title of the book and the author's name. For Standard Ebooks productions, the cover is an SVG image generated from a supplied source image, the book title and author name using the <code class="path">build-images</code> tool.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="title-page">
				<h3>Title page</h3>
				<p>The title page lists the title of the book and the author's name. or Standard Ebooks productions, the title page <code class="path">./text/titlepage.xhtml</code> includes an SVG image generated from a supplied image, the book title and author name using the <code class="path">build-images</code> tool. Using an SVG in this way avoids the need to embed any fonts.</p>
				<p>The titlepage is always part of the front matter of the book.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="imprint">
				<h3>Imprint</h3>
				<p>The imprint contains information about the publisher of the book. In the case of Standard Ebooks, we supply a template <code class="path">./text/imprint.xhtml</code> with our standard release information and the Standard Ebooks logo. The only thing which needs to be changed in this template are the references and links for the source of the content text and page scans.</p>
				<p>The imprint is always part of the front matter of the book.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="dedication">
				<h3>Dedication</h3>
				<p>A dedication is an inscription at the start of a work and is usually a tribute to some person or persons who the author wishes to honour. There is no template supplied by Standard Ebooks, but it can be based on dedications in other projects. It must be placed in a file <code class="path">./text/dedication.xhtml</code>.</p>
				<p>The dedication is always part of the front matter of the book.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="epigraph">

				<p>If the epigraph is a poem or quotation from poetry, it must follow the standards for verse described in <a href="high-level-structural-patterns.html">High-Level Structural Patterns</a></p>
				<p>The epigraph is always part of the front matter of the book.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="acknowledgements">
				<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
				<p>Acknowledgements are a list of persons or organizations who the author wishes to thank, generally for helping with the creation of the book.

				<p>An introduction is part of the body matter.</p>
				<p>The distinction between foreword, preface and introduction is a subtle one and Standard Ebooks authors should generally follow how the author has chosen to title and place these sections. However, more information on the distinction between these terms can be found at the <a href="http://www.writersandeditors.com/preface_foreword_or_introduction_57375.htm">Writers and Editors</a> website.</p>

			</section>
			<section id="list-of-illustrations">
